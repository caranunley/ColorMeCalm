/** Color Me Calm!
I have created a 9x9 grid, where each cell randomly generates a number
between 0 and 4 every time the code is run. The user is encouraged to 
color in the grid corresponding to each other. Meaning, pick a color for 
2 and color all of the cells with 2 in it that color! The user can change
colors by pressing down on any key - these colors are randomly generated 
as well! Once the user colors in all of the boxes, they will be left with 
a beautiful mosaic!
